# Survey Program

The code is a Java program that asks users a series of questions about their political beliefs and uses Bayes’ Theorem to guess their political party based on their responses. The program uses a 2D array to store the responses of individuals from each political party to each question. The program then asks the user the same questions and scales their answers to a range from –2 to +2. It then calculates the probability of the user’s response for each party by considering the responses of each party to that same. The program multiplies the probabilities of each response for each party to obtain a score for each party. The party with the highest score is then selected as the user’s political party.
